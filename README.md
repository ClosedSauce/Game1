Game1 - Worm

A very simple implementation of game Worm "matopeli".

Made 2013 by [JTS-FIN](https://github.com/JTS-FIN) and [tal512](https://github.com/tal512) as a participant for [One Game a Month challenge](https://onegameamonth.com/). 

Works with Python 2 or 3, requires PyGame >= 1.9 installed (install with `pip install pygame`).
